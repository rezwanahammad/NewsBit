*   **Core Libraries & Architecture:**
    *   Android SDK (Min SDK 23, Target SDK 34)
    *   AndroidX Libraries (AppCompat, ConstraintLayout, etc.)
    *   Material Components for UI
    *   View Binding
    *   Fragments for modular UI components
    *   RecyclerView for efficient list display
    *   ViewPager and TabLayout for tabbed navigation
*   **Networking:**
    *   Retrofit: For making API calls to `newsapi.org`.
    *   Glide: For loading and caching images.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   Firebase Authentication: For handling user sign-up and sign-in.

## Setup and Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **API Key for newsapi.org:**
    This project uses `newsapi.org` to fetch news articles. An API key is required to use their service.
    *   **Current API Key (for evaluation/testing only):** `1986db20cc1b4dd583ac779156575885`
        *   This key is currently hardcoded in `app/src/main/java/com/example/newsbit/MainActivity.java` and `app/src/main/java/com/example/newsbit/HomeFragment.java`.
    *   **Recommendation:** For development or personal use, it is strongly recommended to:
        1.  Obtain your own free API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org).
        2.  Store it securely. A common practice is to add it to your `local.properties` file (which should be in `.gitignore`):
            ```properties
            NEWS_API_KEY="YOUR_OWN_API_KEY"
            ```
        3.  Access it in your `build.gradle.kts` file and expose it via `BuildConfig`:
            ```kotlin
            // app/build.gradle.kts
            android {
                // ...
                defaultConfig {
                    // ...
                    buildConfigField("String", "NEWS_API_KEY", ""${providers.gradleProperty("NEWS_API_KEY").getOrElse("")}"")
                }
            }
            ```
        4.  Replace the hardcoded key in the Java files with `BuildConfig.NEWS_API_KEY`.

3.  **Firebase Setup:**
    *   This project is configured to use Firebase Authentication.
    *   To connect it to your own Firebase project:
        1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
        2.  Create a new Firebase project (or use an existing one).
        3.  Add an Android app to your Firebase project with the package name `com.example.newsbit`.
        4.  Download the `google-services.json` file provided by Firebase.
        5.  Place the `google-services.json` file in the `app/` directory of this project.
        6.  Enable Email/Password sign-in provider in Firebase Console under Authentication > Sign-in method.

4.  **Build and Run:**
    *   Open the project in Android Studio.
    *   Allow Gradle to sync and download dependencies.
    *   Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
